# Overview
This repository is the central hub for my technical portfolio. I design and build end-to-end systems involving API integrations, workflow automation, dispatch platforms, eCommerce logic, POS systems, loyalty engines, and real-time event pipelines.

My work spans:  
- event-driven architecture  
- multi-system automations  
- POS → eCommerce → dispatch integrations  
- webhook engineering  
- reverse engineering undocumented APIs  
- building high-impact operational tooling  

Every project here is based on **real production work** supporting high-volume cannabis delivery and eCommerce operations.

# Highlighted Projects

## 1. PostPay Automation
A fully automated payment-ingestion and Slack-notification engine processing Zelle, Cash App, Venmo, and Apple Pay signals in real time.

**Tech:** Python, SQLite, Slack API, Gmail/IMAP  
**Repository:** https://github.com/jburleigh92/PostPay  
**Architecture:** `architecture/PostPay_system_diagram`  
**Case Study:** `case-studies/PostPay`

**Business Outcome**
- Eliminated manual dispatcher verification for ~70–100 payments/day.  
- Reduced order delays caused by “payment confirmation waiting.”  
- Created an audit log reducing disputes and lost revenue.

**Why This Matters for Solutions Engineering**
Shows ability to design a multi-system pipeline, solve operational bottlenecks, and build reliable real-time automation.

---

## 2. AutoEnrollEngine
Real-time customer verification, profile creation, opt-in sync, and SMS notifications triggered by Tookan driver “Verified Customer” events.

**Tech:** Python, Flask, Selenium, Alpine IQ API, Tookan Webhooks  
**Repository:** https://github.com/jburleigh92/AutoEnrollEngine  
**Architecture:** `architecture/AutoEnrollEngine_system_diagram`  
**Case Study:** `case-studies/AutoEnrollEngine`

**Business Outcome**
- Automatically converted “in-delivery verified customers” into full CRM profiles.  
- Increased opt-ins, loyalty attachment, and SMS deliverability.  
- Removed manual dispatcher tasks and human delays.

**Why This Matters for Solutions Engineering**
Demonstrates system orchestration, API chaining, event-triggered automation, and cross-platform workflow design.

## 3. BakedBudz Store v1 → v2
A complete rebuild of the BakedBudz online store.

**v1:** Blaze-powered store with significant plugin and API limitations  
**v2:** Fully custom WooCommerce architecture with middleware, catalog mapping, loyalty support, and integrated dispatch UI.

**Architecture:** `architecture/bakedbudz_system_diagram`  
**Case Study:** `case-studies/bakedbudz.store`

**Business Outcome**
- Improved conversion rates by removing Blaze plugin constraints.  
- Enabled flexible promotions, tracking UI, and API-driven inventory logic.  
- Reduced vendor dependency and enabled full ownership of the commerce stack.

**Why This Matters for Solutions Engineering**
Shows product thinking, migration design, API validation, and ability to diagnose/replace failing vendor systems.

# Technical Strengths

### Integration Design
Designing clean, predictable data flows between multiple platforms—mapping payloads, identifying failure modes, and creating fallback logic.

### Reverse Engineering
Diagnosing undocumented APIs, plugin limitations, sandbox mismatch behavior, and inconsistent webhook payloads.

### Operational Awareness
Systems designed with real-world constraints: delivery radius, ID verification, compliance, dispatch timing, and peak-volume behavior.

### Automation & Tooling
Many of these tools replaced manual dispatcher workflows, reducing operational workload by **70–90%**.
