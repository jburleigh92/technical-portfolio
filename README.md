# Overview
This repository is the central hub for my technical portfolio. I design and build end-to-end systems involving API integrations, workflow automation, dispatch platforms, eCommerce logic, POS systems, loyalty engines, and real-time event pipelines.

My work spans:  
- event-driven architecture  
- multi-system automations  
- POS → eCommerce → dispatch integrations  
- webhook engineering  
- reverse engineering undocumented APIs  
- building high-impact operational tooling  

Every project in this portfolio is based on real production work I designed or built to support high-volume cannabis delivery and eCommerce operations.

# Technical Strengths

### Integration Design
Designing the data flow between multiple platforms—mapping payloads, identifying failure modes, implementing fallback logic.

### Reverse Engineering
Diagnosing undocumented APIs, plugin limitations, sandbox issues, and unexpected webhook payloads.

### Operational Awareness
Systems designed around real-world constraints: delivery radius, ID verification, dispatch timing, compliance, and peak-volume conditions.

### Automation & Tooling
Many of these tools replaced manual dispatcher workflows, reducing operational load by 70–90%.
