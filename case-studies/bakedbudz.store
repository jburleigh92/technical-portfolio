# Case Study: BakedBudz Store v1 → v2  
**Role:** Systems Architect & Technical Operations Lead  
**Platforms:** Blaze POS API, WooCommerce, Custom PHP Plugin, WordPress, Webhooks, Tookan/Onfleet-style dispatch systems, SMS/Loyalty platforms, ID Verification APIs

---

## Overview

This case study documents the full lifecycle of designing, architecting, and co-developing both versions of the BakedBudz eCommerce platform — from the original Blaze-powered v1 store to the fully independent v2 rebuild.

Across both versions, I was responsible for:
- defining the system architecture  
- mapping API behavior and webhook flows  
- validating developer work  
- reverse-engineering undocumented behavior  
- ensuring operational integrity across ordering, catalog, inventory, dispatch, payments, and loyalty  

The result was a fully functioning multi-system eCommerce & delivery platform capable of supporting 50+ orders/day with automated verification, dispatch routing, catalog sync, and loyalty logic.

# V1: Blaze Plugin Store (Constraints, Failures, and Architecture Limits)

### What v1 was built on
The first version of the store used:
- Blaze’s deprecated WordPress plugin  
- Outdated API documentation  
- Limited hooks for intercepting checkout, shipping rules, or inventory behavior  
- No ability to embed real-time order tracking  

This plugin was no longer supported by Blaze, which resulted in:
- errors in tax calculation  
- broken catalog updates  
- inconsistent cart validation  
- incorrect inventory pulls  
- webhook failures that the developer could not fix (Blaze wouldn’t patch them)  

### My role in v1
Even though the plugin handled core functionality, I had to:
- read through Blaze’s legacy Store API docs  
- test endpoint behavior manually in Postman  
- map Blaze → WordPress → WooCommerce data flow  
- help the overseas developer translate API behavior into actual UI/UX requirements  
- troubleshoot inconsistencies caused by Blaze’s plugin  
- determine which functions could be overwritten and which could not  

### Key problems identified
I diagnosed the core issues that made v1 unsustainable:
- **No native tracking UI** (only external links)
- **Catalog mismatches** due to Blaze’s plugin caching
- **Inability to modify checkout logic**
- **API rate-limit failures**
- **Plugin bugs with no long-term support**

This pushed us toward a clean-slate rebuild.

# V2: Independent WooCommerce Build (Full Custom Architecture)

### Why v2 was necessary  
After deep analysis, I proposed a redesign because:
- relying on Blaze’s deprecated store API was a systemic risk  
- we needed full control of checkout logic, delivery rules, loyalty flows, and customer state  
- the business roadmap required new integrations not possible in v1  
- we needed a platform that could scale and potentially be white-labeled  

### What changed in v2
V2 removed Blaze entirely from the eCommerce layer and instead used:

- **WooCommerce as the main ordering system**
- **Custom API middleware** pushing orders into Blaze  
- **Independent catalog management with mapping tables**
- **Full control of UI/UX for promotions, cart rules, inventory behavior**
- **Built-in order tracking (similar to DoorDash/Uber)**
- **Flexibility to integrate any dispatch system (Tookan/Onfleet)**

### My responsibilities in v2
I was responsible for the full technical architecture:
- defined each integration requirement and data contract  
- mapped the order lifecycle (cart → order → Blaze → dispatch → loyalty)  
- identified system limits (inventory, discounts, taxes, delivery radius)  
- ran API tests to validate feasibility  
- guided developer sprints and reviewed deliverables  
- designed fallback logic when APIs failed  
- ensured catalog structures stayed consistent across WooCommerce and Blaze  
- validated webhook behavior during live traffic  

### Real impact
With v2:
- checkout failures dropped significantly  
- catalog accuracy improved  
- fully embedded tracking increased customer trust  
- developer velocity improved because I translated operational needs into actual technical specs  
- the system became independent from Blaze’s plugin limitations

# Technical Highlights (Why This Case Study Matters for Recruiters)

### 1. **Cross-platform integration design**
This project required coordinating:
- Blaze POS  
- WordPress / WooCommerce  
- Tookan/Onfleet APIs  
- Loyalty systems  
- SMS systems  
- Custom PHP middleware  
- Webhooks across 3 systems  

### 2. **Reverse-engineering**
I identified undocumented and deprecated behaviors in Blaze’s plugin by testing endpoints directly and comparing outputs to live order behavior.

### 3. **Real-time operational constraints**
I architected around:
- delivery radius handling  
- driver routing logic  
- ID verification dependencies  
- catalog taxonomy  
- inventory sync constraints  

### 4. **Developer collaboration**
The offshore developer understood code, not operational logic.  
My job was to:
- translate real operational workflows into technical specs  
- validate behavior through API testing and webhook tracing  
- guide architecture choices based on compliance, UX, and system limits  

This mirrors how solutions engineers work in real SaaS environments.

### 5. **Scalability**
The v2 redesign was intentionally built to support:
- white-labeling  
- multi-store expansion  
- plug-in dispatch providers  
- plug-in verification systems  
- automated workflows

# Final Outcome

The combined v1 → v2 work demonstrates my ability to:
- architect multi-platform systems  
- work between developers and operators  
- integrate APIs across POS, eCommerce, dispatch, loyalty, and notification systems  
- reverse-engineer limitations and design around them  
- ship production systems under real-world time and business pressure  

This is one of the strongest case studies in my portfolio because it captures:
- systems thinking  
- integration engineering  
- operational awareness  
- API literacy  
- cross-functional leadership
