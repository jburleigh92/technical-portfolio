# PostPay Automation (Case Study)
🔗 **Repo:** https://githubgithub.com/jburleigh92/PostPay/tree/main/PostPay4

---

## 📌 Summary
PostPay is an automated payment-verification and dispatch workflow system built to support Baked Budz, a cannabis delivery business processing 70–100+ orders per day.  
It replaces manual payment checking across Zelle, Venmo, Cash App, Apple Pay, and text confirmations with a real-time, error-free, fully automated pipeline.

---

## 🧨 The Problem
Before PostPay, the dispatch workflow was slow, inconsistent, and vulnerable to human error:

- Payments had to be checked manually across multiple apps  
- Drivers were sometimes sent out before payment confirmation  
- No single-source audit trail existed  
- Mistakes happened frequently during peak rush times  
- Dispatcher workload was overwhelming  
- Scaling up order volume was nearly impossible  

These issues reduced efficiency, increased labor needs, and introduced financial risk.

---

## 🚀 The Solution
PostPay automates the entire payment verification and dispatching process:

- Normalizes transactions from Zelle, Venmo, Cash App, Apple Pay, and “Other” payment types  
- Detects duplicates and ensures only valid new payments move forward  
- Maintains an SQLite-backed audit log for full traceability  
- Sends real-time Slack alerts with driver routing instructions  
- Implements a sleep-window (12 AM – 9 AM) to prevent after-hours dispatching  
- Logs errors, warnings, and events for operational visibility  
- Runs on a scheduled interval with automated decision-making  

PostPay transformed a manual multi-step workflow into a fast, scalable, automated system.

## 📉 Impact (Real-World Results)
- Reduced verification time from **30–45 minutes → under 10 seconds**  
- Eliminated all “payment mismatch” dispatching errors  
- Enabled operational growth from ~30 → **70–100+ orders per day** without extra staff  
- Reduced dispatcher workload by **over 80%**  
- Increased delivery speed and customer satisfaction  
- Created a permanent audit log supporting refunds, disputes, and QA

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture
> *(Diagram should live in `/architecture/postpay-flow.png` or `/architecture/system-architecture.png`)*

**System Flow:**

1. Payment apps → export/notification  
2. Parser layer normalizes each payment type  
3. Duplicate detection + DB validation  
4. Slack bot sends real-time dispatch message  
5. Scheduler runs the automation throughout the day  
6. Logger captures events for debugging and audit  

This modular architecture allows PostPay to scale and support new payment methods easily.
