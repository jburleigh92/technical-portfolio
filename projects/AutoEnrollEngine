# AutoEnrollEngine (Case Study)

## Summary  
AutoEnrollEngine is an automated tracking-analysis and ETA-normalization engine designed to convert real-time delivery tracking pages into actionable, structured data.  
It provides a webhook interface that receives tracking URLs, performs dynamic webpage scraping using Selenium and headless Chrome, extracts live ETA values, normalizes them into meaningful delivery windows, and returns machine-readable results for downstream automations.

The system enables any logistics, delivery, or dispatching workflow to access reliable ETA data programmatically—without human checking or manual page monitoring.

## The Problem  
Many delivery operations rely on third-party tracking portals that expose ETA values only through dynamic web interfaces.  
This creates several challenges:

- ETAs require **manual checking** by staff.  
- Tracking pages often load content dynamically with JavaScript.  
- No stable API exists for capturing real-time ETA values.  
- Dispatch decisions are slowed when staff must repeatedly refresh tracking pages.  
- Scaling becomes difficult when operators cannot track multiple orders efficiently.  

These limitations introduce operational delays, prevent automation, and reduce the ability to handle higher delivery volumes.

---

## The Solution  
AutoEnrollEngine creates a reliable, automated way to extract ETA information from dynamic tracking pages:

- Accepts webhook requests containing a tracking URL  
- Launches headless Chrome via Selenium to load the page  
- Waits for the ETA UI element to fully render  
- Extracts the live ETA value in minutes  
- Normalizes ETA into consistent time windows (e.g., “25–35 mins”)  
- Returns structured JSON suitable for dispatching, routing, or messaging workflows  

By converting a webpage-only ETA into structured data, the system provides the foundation for fully automated delivery workflows.

---

## Impact  
AutoEnrollEngine delivers operational improvements immediately:

- Removes the need to manually check tracking pages  
- Provides consistent and repeatable ETA extraction  
- Integrates easily into dispatching or messaging services  
- Enables automation of customer notifications, routing logic, and SLA tracking  
- Reduces operator workload and speeds up decision-making  
- Works with any tracking system that renders ETAs in the browser  

The system is designed for production use and can be deployed in Docker for predictable, repeatable operation.

## High-Level Architecture  

```
Webhook → Payload Validation → Selenium Scraping → ETA Extraction → ETA Normalization → JSON Response
```

**Flow Description**

1. External system sends a POST request containing a tracking URL.  
2. Payload is validated to prevent malformed requests.  
3. A headless Chrome session loads the tracking page.  
4. The scraper waits for the ETA element to appear.  
5. Raw ETA value (minutes) is parsed from the UI.  
6. ETA is normalized into consistent time windows.  
7. JSON response is returned to the requesting system.

This modular structure isolates each responsibility, making the system easy to extend with additional scrapers, business rules, or integrations.

## Key Learnings  

- Built a resilient scraping pipeline capable of handling dynamic, JavaScript-rendered content  
- Developed a clean webhook processing stack with strict input validation  
- Designed a modular Selenium architecture optimized for reuse and testing  
- Introduced structured ETA normalization to improve consistency across multiple tracking systems  
- Created a Docker-ready Python service suitable for production automation  
- Demonstrated the ability to turn manual UI-based workflows into automated data pipelines
